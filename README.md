# serverless-image-processing.
This project demonstrates a **serverless image processing pipeline** using AWS services.   When a user uploads an image to an **S3 bucket**, an **AWS Lambda function** is triggered.   The Lambda function resizes the image (or applies transformations like watermarking) and saves the processed image into another **S3 bucket**.
